A new version of Rss is out. It focuses on code clean up at cost of BC breaks.

Interfaces IXmlConvertible and IRssExtension were renamed: we dropped the I prefix.

Property Generator::$dataSource now only accepts Closure or null and $protocol in Cloud now accepts new enum Nexendrie\Rss\CloudProtocol.

Nette style events were replaced with PSR-14 event dispatcher.

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
