A new version of Rss is out. It adds RSS extension CreativeCommons.

pubDate in items now has to be a DateTime, it is for consistency with (return value of callbacks for) lastBuildDate and pubDate in channel. It is now possible to set isPermaLink for item's guid.

language now has to be an enum Nexendrie\Rss\Extensions\RssCore\Iso639Language or Nexendrie\Rss\Extensions\RssCore\RssLanguage.

Parameter $parent of method XmlConvertible::appendToXml is no longer taken by reference, it was not necessary.

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
