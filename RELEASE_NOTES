A new version of Rss is out. It adds RSS extension CreativeCommons.

pubDate in items now has to be a DateTime, it is for consistency with (return value of callbacks for) lastBuildDate and pubDate in channel. It is now possible to set isPermaLink for item's guid.

Parameter $parent of method XmlConvertible::appendToXml is no longer taken by reference, it was not necessary.

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
