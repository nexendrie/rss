Contributting to Nexendrie Project
==================================

So you wish to make a contribution to Nexendrie Project? Great, just read this document beforehand.

Where to contribute
-------------------

All contributions should be made on [GitLab] (https://gitlab.com/nexendrie). Our packages are also on [GitHub](https://github.com/nexendrie) but just because Composer has issues with GitLab.

Coding standards
----------------

If you are writting any code for the project, be sure to follow our coding standards. Its definition for code sniffer is a part of [nexendrie/code-quality] (https://gitlab.com/nexendrie/code-quality/blob/master/ruleset.xml) package.

Test the code
-------------

Do not forget to write tests for new features, we do not want untested code in the codebase. Also all tests for the merge request must pass. That includes syntax checks, compilation with coding standards and unit tests.

Things to work on
-----------------

* Documentation

Some of our packages are missing documentation, documentation of some packages is outdated/could use better wording. Any help is welcome.

* Bugs

We all are humans thus prone to errors. Do not hesitate to point them out and/or propose fixes.

* New features

Our packages are not completed (well, most of them at least). There are some things we would like to add, just check [issues] (https://gitlab.com/groups/nexendrie/issues) on GitLab. If there is something missing from your point of view, open a new issue. But be aware that we do not have to share your opinion so sometimes you will have to convince us.
